# LLM, What the Hell

Aug 19th — my second birthday. After finishing my 18-month military service, I’ve returned to the world, ready to find my footing again. And this is where it all begins.

## Plans

- Recent AI models research paper reviews (GPT-5, GPT-OSS, Claude)  
- AI Agents research paper reviews (LangChain, LlamaIndex)  
- Transformers methods / Training methods / RAG  

To be honest, there’s so much to catch up on. It’s kind of scary — I feel a bit overwhelmed.

## Reference (study links)

I'm currently studying using [offical guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/). Since it's an official document, there's a reason why I trust it the most. I'll gradually broaden the scope, but for now, I'm focusing on learning through this.
